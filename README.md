# Mozfest

This repo contains some examples to get you started with [Wellcome Collection's images API](https://api.wellcomecollection.org/catalogue/v2/images). The repo was created specifically for [one of our sessions at mozfest 2021](https://schedule.mozillafestival.org/session/93CJ7Y-1), but should be usable by anyone!

## Getting started with python

Try running our notebooks in [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wellcomecollection/mozfest/blob/master/python/notebooks), or have a look at the [README](python/) to run the notebooks locally using docker.
