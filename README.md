# Mozfest

This repo contains some examples to get you started with [Wellcome Collection's images API](https://api.wellcomecollection.org/catalogue/v2/images). You can read more about it in [our developer docs](https://developers.wellcomecollection.org/catalogue/v2/images). The repo was created specifically for [one of our sessions at mozfest 2021](https://schedule.mozillafestival.org/session/93CJ7Y-1), but should be usable by anyone!

## Getting started with python

Try running our notebooks in [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wellcomecollection/mozfest/blob/main/python/notebooks/01%20-%20open%20an%20image.ipynb), or have a look at the [README](python/) to run the notebooks locally using docker.

## Getting started with Observable and JavaScript

[We have a simple Observable notebook setup](https://next.observablehq.com/@jamesgorrie/mozfest) for you to get started with.
